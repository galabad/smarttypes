The web is vast. 
The opportunity for discovery is also vast.
</p><p>
We build tools that help people find, engage, and learn from target communities and community leaders.
</p><p>
Our first tool (in the works now) uses modern learning algorithms 
(<a href="http://www.graphlab.ml.cmu.edu/">http://www.graphlab.ml.cmu.edu/</a>) to identify twitter 
communities, leaders, and contextually interesting content.
The guys at <a href="http://www.graphlab.ml.cmu.edu/">graphlab</a> are crazy helpful and supportive.
78% of our value comes from the motivation and brilliance of these guys.  
</p><p>
Connect SmartTypes with your Twitter account, and we'll 'naturally' cluster your social graph into related communities.
We'll cluster the people you follow, the people they follow, and the people they follow
(A massive social universe that revolves around you).
We'll cluster this universe into related communities, highlight the leaders of these communities, and highlight the stuff these communities find interesting.

"Every man mistakes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world." - Arthur Schophenhauer

Get in touch if this kind of thing excites you.
