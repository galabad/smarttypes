A special thanks to the guys at <a href="http://www.graphlab.ml.cmu.edu/">Graphlab</a>
for the lightning fast implementation of <a href="www.cs.utoronto.ca/~amnih/papers/bpmf.pdf">Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization using Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a>.  
See the <a href="http://www.graphlab.ml.cmu.edu/pmf.html">GraphLab collaborative filtering library</a> 
for more info on efficient probabilistic matrix/tensor factorization.
