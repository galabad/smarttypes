The following is related to graph embedding or graph layouts.
At a high level it's reducing a graph to 2 or 3 dimensions.
I won't get into why this is useful. 
It's enough to say that graphs are convenient abstractions that can be used to model complex problems.
Assuming the inherit value of graphs.  
Reducing the dimensionality of a graph (learning it's essence) is also valuable.
There a lot of methods of dimension reduction.
The one i will describe here is the coolest (most natural) method i've found.
</p>

<p>
Let's assume we're interested in a 2d graph layout.
Stay w/ me for a second, i'll go over this quickly and then go back in more detail.
We're going to randomly scatter all the nodes in our graph on a 2d surface.
Our nodes will then interact w/ all the other nodes on this 2d surface until they settle down to a some kind of equilibrium.
This is know generally as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_minimization">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_minimization</a>
and is commonly used for modeling/simulating physical systems.
Fans of complexity and social science will see a lot of similarities w/ this and Agent Based Modeling. 
</p>

<p>
Lets talk for a minute about our goal.
I'm interested in finding communities of people.
Once we're able to identity niche communities, we should be able to easily id trends and influence within these communities.
This has obvious social and market research implications.
Imagine being able to id the best group of people for any topic or interest.
Photographers in Cleveland, or the best complexity theorists in whole world.
This is possible w/ online social networks.

<p>
Luckily Dr. Andreas Noack has done all the hard work. 
Noackâ€™s LinLog energy model is considered the best force model to preserve the community structure of a graph.
The following is from his 2007 paper
<a href="http://www-sst.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/~an/Publications/JGAA2007.pdf">Energy Models for Graph Clustering</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
edge-repulsion LinLog energy minimize the ratio of the mean distance 
between connected end nodes to the mean distance between all end nodes.
</blockquote>

<p>
Put simply Noack's method minimizes the average distance between connected nodes while maximizing the distance between all other nodes.
He proves this is possible w/ to simple rules: linear repulsion and logarithmic attraction.

<p>
I gotta go, more to come!
