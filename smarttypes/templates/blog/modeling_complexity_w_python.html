<h1>
Modeling complexity w/ python (part 1)
</h1>

<!--
<p>
This post is a derivation of 
<a href="http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4380/pyohio-2011-using-pymc-to-clus">a talk i gave on complexity and social network analysis</a> 
@ <a href="http://pyohio.org/">PyOhio 2011</a> in Columbus, OH.
</p>

<p>
The main point of the talk was/is to inspire curiosity!
</p>

<p>
Developing the talk, and the project related to the talk, has been a slow journey.
I enjoy thinking about complexity, and how computers can help us model/untangle it.
The journey then, is the point i suppose.
</p>

<h2>Everything is related</h2>
-->

<p>
The universe is complex.
Everything around us (our weather, milk, yards, economy, etc...) operate under a veil of complexity.
Humans have a long history of trying to tame this complexity beast.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;
Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'
Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land;
Man got to tell himself he understand." -- Kurt Vonnegut
</p>
</blockquote>

<!--<p>
This is the book that got be started down this path: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Making-Science-James-Gleick/dp/0140092501">Chaos: Making a New Science</a>.
I like to lump 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaos theory</a> 
and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems">modern complex systems research</a> under the same name; 'complexity science'.
</p>-->

<p>
Arguably, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">the butterfly effect</a> is complexity science's crowning achievement.
Show me another complexity inspired movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Butterfly_Effect">starring man of science, Ashton Kutcher</a>
and i'll rethink that claim.
</p>

<p>
The butterfly effect is a simple idea.
A butterfly fluttering her wings in Casablanca can effect the weather in Cleveland.
This is an example used to make a larger point.
Things are related in weird/crazy ways.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps everything is related!
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism">Here's what wikipedia has to say:</a>
<!--From August 23 2011-->
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"The philosophical argument here would be that the big bang triggered every single action, and possibly mental thought, through the system of cause and effect."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:center;padding-top:20px;">"everything under the sun is in tune"</p>

<p style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:20px;">
<img src="/static/images/blog/dark_side_of_the_moon.png" style="width:200px;padding-top:0;" alt="dark_side_of_the_moon.png"/>
</p>

<p>
Also from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism">the wikipedia article on determinism</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called stochastic. Because of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically... Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a stochastic model even though the underlying system is governed by deterministic equations."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even if we could measure and compute everything's influence on everything else, we'd still run into something akin to the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</a>.
In short, we need to embrace uncertainty!

<h2>Predicting the actions of humans</h2>

<p>
The stock market is a perfect forum for complexity analysis.
The game is simple, predict the future better than your opponents and win a lots of money.
</p>

<!--<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading#cite_note-advtrade-4">In 2009, computer driven, algorithmic trading firms accounted for 73% of all US equity trading volume</a>.

<p>
"Even apart from the instability due to speculation, there is the instability due to the characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than mathematical expectations." -- John Maynard Keynes

<p>
This is the paper that got me interested in social network analysis:
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3003">Twitter mood predicts the stock market</a>.
</p>

<p>
No small feat!
The financial industry spends a lot of money on methods to predict the future.
A lot of money is really an understatement.
How/why would twitter be good at predicting the market?
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Think of Twitter as a network of human sensors." -- Rick Lawrence, head of IBM's Machine Learning Group
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Human social networks</h2>

<p>
Imagine all us crazy humans as a single, interconnected system.  
A lot of people have had this thought, you've probably heard the term 'the human super organism'.
</p>

<p>
Taken in aggregate, the human super organism is an amazing analytical machine.
We experience, categorize, learn, and teach.
In this way we gain collective knowledge over time.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Quality which creates the world emerges as a relationship between man and his experience. He is a participant in the creation of all things. The measure of all things." -- Robert Pirsig</p>

<h2>Online social networks</h2>

<p>
The web lets us experience, categorize, learn, and teach w/ great speed and ease.
We're still discovering what this means.
Here are a few of many examples:
</p>

<p>
This is from 
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424052970204138204576598942105167646-lMyQjAxMTAxMDAwMzEwNDMyWj.html">
a WSJ article on Virginia's magnitude 5.8 earthquake that hit last August
</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Never have scientists had so much readily accessible, real-time data about what people say...
Twitter texts are as timely as a pulse beat and, taken together, automatically compile the raw material of social history.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is from <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=6ef12558b44258382452fcf02942396a&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">
the DARPA Social Media in Strategic Communication RFP
</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Recognize persuasion campaign structures and influence operations across social media 
sites and communities.  Counter messaging of detected adversary influence operations.
Identify participants and intent, and measure effects of persuasion campaigns.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's right, "Counter messaging". It's also about influence! 
</p>

<h2>To be continued</h2>
<p>
OK, that sets the stage for implementation.
<a href="/blog/modeling_complexity_w_python_2">Our next post</a> 
will move from crazy theory to actual code.
