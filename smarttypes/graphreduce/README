graphreduce uses distributed, nonlinear, dimension reduction methods to compress an input graph

reduce a large graph to machine and/or human digestible 2d or 3d data

[insert example here]

we depend on numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, and some python physics library we havent decided on yet:

graphreduce is under active development -- when complete it will:

 - provide tests and plots comparing different nonlinear dimension reduction methods

 - process large graphs in parallel w/out running out of memory

 - work w/ google maps to display pretty 2d visualizations

 - work w/ weighted directed and undirected graphs
