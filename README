This is the source code for the www.smarttypes.org web application.

If you want to install SmartTypes please contact us at hello@smarttypes.org.  
We'll walk you through installing the dependencies and configuring for your environment.

If you simply want to use the SmartTypes service visit www.smarttypes.org

Here is a description of the SmartTypes service:

Connect SmartTypes with your Twitter account, and we'll 'naturally' cluster your social graph into related communities. We'll cluster the people you follow, the people they follow, and the people they follow (A massive social universe that revolves around you). We'll cluster this universe into related communities, highlight the leaders of these communities, and highlight the stuff these communities find interesting. 

A special thanks to the guys at http://www.graphlab.ml.cmu.edu/.  78% of our value comes from their motivation and brilliance. 

SmartTypes also depends on:
 - numpy.scipy.org
 - github.com/tweepy/tweepy
